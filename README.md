###### Chemistry Tools Copyright Â© 2014 Ariel Mordoch

Chemistry Tools is meant to be used as a command line program that contains conversions and analyses useful to chemistry.
In future versions it will be possible to use the program as a library.

Currently, I am focusing on the backend code, and as such, some program functions may not be accessible to users for some time.
