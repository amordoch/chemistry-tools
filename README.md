###### Chemistry Tools Copyright Â© 2014 Ariel Mordoch

Chemistry Tools is meant to be used as a command line program that contains conversions and analyses useful to chemistry.
In future versions it will be possible to use the program as a library.

Most of the methods behave like normal objects, but the Conversion class does not (it is abstract and its methods are static).
